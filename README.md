By Nguyen P. Nguyen ‚Äî Technical Account Manager | Data Analyst


üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introduction:

Hi, I'm Nguyen (Win), a Technical Account Manager at a leading hardware manufacturing company. I use data to drive sales strategy and customer success. I lead strategic support for IT resellers across Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. This analytics project explores 36 months of sales, training, and opportunity data to uncover actionable insights that can inform go-to-market strategy, engagement planning, and enablement ROI.


üéØ Project Objectives:

- Identify Top 5 accounts with highest growth potential
- Analyze year-over-year sales trends and engagement levels
- Track training sessions by topic and their resulting opportunities
- Measure rep enablement and account-level engagement
- Recommend actionable steps to maximize ROI from sales efforts


üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
  
|  Area              |    Tools                                        |
|  ------------------|-----------------------------------------------  |
|  Data Storage      |    Salesforce and Internal Sales Reports        | 
|  Language          |    SQL (MYSQL)                                  | 
|  Data Analysis     |    SQL and Excel (PowerQuerry and Pivot Table)  |
|  Visualization     |    Excel Charts                                 |


üßπ Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis:

Collecting Data:
- Exported account, opportunity, and training data from Salesforce (opportunity stage, close date, amount, account, rep name, training notes).
- Consolidated internal sales reports from finance and channel teams (closed sales per account, per year, by state and partner type).

SQL was used to:
-  Join and normalize data from Salesforce and internal reports.
-  Clean null or duplicate entries and standardize naming conventions.
-  Segment accounts by state, channel type, and employee size.
-  Calculate year-over-year sales, training-to-opportunity conversion.
-  Perform exploratory analysis such as aggregating sales by account and region.


Excel was used to:
-  Clean and transform Salesforce exports using Power Query.
-  Create pivot tables to slice sales and training data by geography and time.
-  Visualize trends in training frequency, sales volume, and rep engagement.

Data Modeling and Building Tables:
- Account table: show summary of all the accounts and their yearly sales
- Training table: show the training topic and the counts per account
- Opportunity: show the total opportunities and average size per account. 

üìà Highlights (Account names have been anonymized as Account #1, #2, etc., to maintain confidentiality.):

- Account #1: 200% growth YoY in 2025 opportunities. High training correlation.
- Account #2: Growing pipeline without much rep engagement.
- Account #3: High rep effort but dropping sales and small opportunities.
- Account #4 & #5: Steady VAR sales, low enablement.


üìä Training vs. Opportunity Count

- Account #1 shows strong training-to-opportunity ratio
- Account #2 is undertrained but trending upward
- Account #3 is high effort, low return


üìö Training Topics ROI:

| Topic                       | Share of Training | Share of Opportunities |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | 
| Selling Storage as Add-On   |    58%            |    45%                 |
| BCDR & 3-2-1 Best Practice  |    26%            |    32%                 |
| Storge for Virtualization   |    12%            |    18%                 |
| Surveillance                |    4%             |    5%                  |


üîé Key Insights:

- Account #1 benefites the most from strategic enablement.
- Account #2 has high growth potential with more training.
- Selling storage as add-on is the most popular and product training topic.
- Account #3‚Äôs engagement needs re-evaluation due to poor sales ROI.
- Instead of focus on our hardware as main solution, having ours attached to be part of multi-vendor solution seem to yield the most results.
- Don't compette, intergrate.

‚úÖ Call to Action:

1. Double Down on High-ROI Topics such as selling storage as add-on and Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.
2. Prioritize Account #2 and similar accounts that were understained but growing.
3. Reevaluate engagement strategy for Account #3 and other similar mid-tier accounts.
4. Increase additional outreach to focus accounts in Ohio and Wisconsin
5. Evaluate engagements, activities and sales pipline in the monthly basis.
